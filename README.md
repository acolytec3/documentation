This repo generates the Protocol Guild [documentation](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

It was heavily refactored in May 2024 to properly document the Pilot and the new components/processes of PGv2 - if you've linked here in external posts, there may be broken links!

For members: the membership list now lives [here](./docs/02-membership.md).

Please note that we do not accept pull requests for minor corrections, such as typos. Instead, we encourage you to open an issue to report these items, and we will compile them into a single update. Thank you!
